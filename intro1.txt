The wet, sickening sound of boots thudding against dampened rooftops was an almost comforting note. It was a noise that you had grown quite accustomed to over the years you had spent in the Dark City. Rain, snow, or fog, there always seemed to be at least one shadowy figure of a man or woman- or Divine knew what else -flitting across them. The streets were clear, nowadays. Plague and curse had long since thinned their ancient stones of honest men. The rooftops? The rooftops offered safety, obscurity, and swift passage for those with less noble hearts. They were a refuge for the cruel, the hated, and the desperate.

Much like yourself.

Your lungs ache as you buckle over, gasping for breath. The rooftops might offer speedy passage to the daring traveler, but only those gifted with plentiful stamina and honed agility can traverse them with ease. Gloved hands grip cold stone as you pant, eyes bent downwards to the stony roof surface, the words of your boss, Miskovine, race through your mind.

"It's a bad career, runner. Playing the double-agent. But time and time again, somebody gets the sparkling idea worming its way into their mind. They think nobody will find them, they can make a little coin. Maybe they can afford a new set of boots next month."

You can picture her now, in your mind's eye. Pale, thin, but with gray eyes that would pierce through the soul of even the most stoic of Crimson Paladins. Covered in dust and dirt from a hundred wretched streets and roofs, and just as sharp as the day you met her.

She fiddled with her worn gloves, no doubt attempting to quell an itching that would never cease so long as she continued to wear such ragged things.

"Of course they fucking can't. We're all suffering in these streets. Theft? Murder? A little lie here and there? Whatever. Everybody does it to survive. But you can't betray your own. When your lineage is choking on their guts in an alley, entombed in the halls of their ancestors, or raving mad in the streets, you stick to what little you have left. You treat your merry band of brigands well, and they have your back until the moon itself shatters. You turn that back upon themâ€¦."

And you shatter their spine. You remember her words as clear as the crystal panes of the Black Palace.
