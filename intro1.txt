The wet, sickening sound of boots thudding against dampened rooftops was an almost comforting note. It was a noise that you had grown quite accustomed to over the years you had spent in the Dark City. Rain, snow, or fog, there always seemed to be at least one shadowy figure of a man or woman- or Divine knew what else -flitting across them. The streets were clear, nowadays. Plague and curse had long since thinned their ancient stones of honest men. The rooftops? The rooftops offered safety, obscurity, and swift passage for those with less noble hearts. They were a refuge for the cruel, the hated, and the desperate.

Much like yourself.

Your lungs ache as you buckle over, gasping for breath. The rooftops might offer speedy passage to the daring traveler, but only those gifted with plentiful stamina and honed agility can traverse them with ease. Gloved hands grip cold stone as you pant, eyes bent downwards to the stony roof surface, the words of your boss, Miskovine, race through your mind.

"It's a bad career, runner. Playing the double-agent. But time and time again, somebody gets the sparkling idea worming its way into their mind. They think nobody will find them, they can make a little coin. Maybe they can afford a new set of boots next month."

You can picture her now, in your mind's eye. Pale, thin, but with gray eyes that would pierce through the soul of even the most stoic of Crimson Paladins. Covered in dust and dirt from a hundred wretched streets and roofs, and just as sharp as the day you met her.

She fiddled with her worn gloves, no doubt attempting to quell an itching that would never cease so long as she continued to wear such ragged things.

"Of course they fucking can't. We're all suffering in these streets. Theft? Murder? A little lie here and there? Whatever. Everybody does it to survive. But you can't betray your own. When your lineage is choking on their guts in an alley, entombed in the halls of their ancestors, or raving mad in the streets, you stick to what little you have left. You treat your merry band of brigands well, and they have your back until the moon itself shatters. You turn that back upon themâ€¦."

And you shatter their spine. You remember her words as clear as the crystal panes of the Black Palace.

Air filling your lungs, your breaths began to slow as relaxation spread through your body. It was dark out, though this was hardly a surprise. The great city of Dredrath was an enormous complex of towers, walls, and bridges spiraling into the inky black of a chasm deep below the surface of the earth. Here in the middle levels of the city, a blanket of inky blackness coated every surface that was not immediately illuminated by lamplight, deep shadows cast by the looming architecture seemed to swallow up the world, and even on the surface the dismal gray that filled the sky did little to help illuminate the craggy and mountainous world, already so dimly lit by a faint star. Looking up, the moon could be seen, nearly full in the sky. This, too, brought no warmth to your heart.

Moontide. It was a name that evoked fear in even the most steadfast of men. Each full moon for the last ten years had brought with it a plague of madness and horror, as citizens screamed, writhed, and transformed into terrible, hostile mutants on the spot. Families locked themselves in their homes, boarded up their windows, and prayed to the Divine and his saints that they would be spared from it.
Most were. But for those who were not so fortunate, only death awaited them. None could explain the coming of the Moontide, but it was no secret that it was an existential threat.

Stamina restored, the journey across the rooftops was a quick one, even for the distance you were forced to travel. Kellach was doing all he could to avoid punishment, but the Spire refused to stop at this level of the city nowadays, except to deliver food, so he was trapped on it, with no choice but to run to the farthest parts of it and pray that Miskovine would forget.

Of course she wouldn't.

But that meant that whoever was sent to eliminate him had to travel a long distance. A carriage would have been a fine way to reach him, in years past. But rioting, blockades, and plague had long left the streets unfit for such a means of transportation, if there were even still those willing to provide it. So it was that leaping through the ancient rooftops of the millennia-old city was the best way for you to reach the traitor. It mightn't have been luxurious, but it kept you alive. And that was good enough.

And as if the threat from the Moontide was not severe enough, plague had struck the city as well. The Red Plague brought its victims to their knees, coughing and bleeding crimson from every orifice. Stories from some of the more traveled ne'er-do-wells told of some levels of the city red with the blood of wailing victims, the sewers choked in their ichor. You couldn't tell if the tales were true, but it wouldn't have surprised you if they were. You'd seen this level collapse enough as it was.

Taking a running jump, a leap carried you off the stone roofs and towards a sturdy lamp-post, long since burned out when the lamp-lighter ceased to come by. Grabbing onto it as you fell, it was a careful matter to shimmy down to your feet back onto the cold stone ground, the broken cobblestones that made up these streets stained and discolored with an unknown fluid.
