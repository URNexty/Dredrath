Dredrath is a wretched city, a once-proud megalopolis wrought of stone and steel that crumbles into ash more and more each and every day. carved into the very earth, the city is built in a massive gaping quarry hole formed out of an ancient ravine. The city itself is no less antiquated, the earliest myths and tales of its people dating back six thousand years. None know what truly existed on this dismal planet before the city was built, only that outside of its distant sister city, Elheim no other large-scale human settlements seem to exist, each city surrounded by their own repertoire of towns and villages that work tireless to supply the enormous cities with raw resources and food.

The city of Dredrath is known to its people as the Inner Circle, for its circular shape, the surrounding farms and towns part of what is known as the Outer Circle. Beyond these lands are the Wildlands, gray craggy mountains and hills in which no society could ever hope to truly thrive, inhabited by nothing but wild animals and the ferocious beastmen, these towering abominations wretched chimeras of animal and man, barely intelligent enough to surpass the most basic warlike tribal society. The smallest of these monstrosities easily reaching eight feet in size, these horrific creatures seem hell-bent on the destruction of all of humanity, and for generations the sisters-in-arms of the Queen's Somber Host have battled them ceaselessly in an effort to repel them. Yet with the unthinkable, the destruction of the city of Elheim by the Beastman hordes, and the subsequent advent of the Moontide, the army is stretched thin, a weakness the monsters have been more than eager to exploit…

*page_break Your birthplace...

Before you were anything at all, you were but a child. Dredians are a sedentary lot, rarely traveling far from the homesteads of their ancestors, be they ancient crumbling halls or windy, grassy fields. Where you born was almost certainly where you were raised, and where you were raised influenced your upbringing without a doubt.

	#I was born within the cramped and towering walls of the Inner Circle...
		The Inner Circle, or the City of Dredrath itself, is an ancient and regal city, standing proudly through over six thousand years. characters born within its labyrinthine walls enjoyed the comforts of "modern" pseudo-1800s technology, housed safely within ancient crumbling stone walls. Yet the last ten years have been one of constant turmoil, suffering, and struggle, and only the strong and clever can truly survive. City-Born characters are likely to have a strong sense of tradition and belonging. Family lineage is very important to Dredians of all classes, and only the most wretched and impoverished forsake or live in ignorance of their family name. All others live close to their kin, walk the halls of their ancestors, and bury their dead in milennia-old ancestral tombs carved into the walls of the great pit that is their city. Additionally, as it is the administrative, political, and religious head of the land, lucky city folk could have found themselves lucrative positions within the government of Dredrath itself

	#I was born in the frontier of the Outer Circle....
		The Outer Circle is a broad domain. Consisting of sizable towns, tiny villages, and meager outposts, the singular purpose of the settlements of the frontier is to produce and provide raw resources to meet the needs of the Inner Circle- the city proper, whose demands have only grown more intense as it grows more industrialized. Yet the advent of the Moontide and the outbreak of plague within the city have lessened the demand greatly, as citizens die in droves. Still, with the bulk of the Somber Host being called to protect the city, the outskirts find themselves less and less protected by the growing hordes of beastmen that seek to destroy it- and some predict that if left unchecked, even the mighty bastion of Dredrath itself will crumble against their might. As a native of the Outer Circle, you likely lived a hard, simple, but relatively happy life, able to enjoy the few lands of your world that posses any true natural beauty, and a wide degree of cultural autonomy.

If only it was still such a nice place to live.

Over the years, you grew into a fine young…

Gender has no bearing on ability, although some elements of Dredian society are strictly bound by perceived sex.
Dredrath is a matriarchal-inclined theocracy, strongly tied to ancient traditions. As the legendary foremothers and saints of humanity are maintained to have been female, the clergy is typically female, although all but the highest stations are allowed to be men. Additionally, the standing army, the Somber Host, is entirely female, often supplemented with shock troops in the form of the all-male Brotherhood of Crimson Paladins, who also serve non-military roles as bodyguards for officials, as well as the occasional male civilian volunteer militia group where necessary. Civilians, however, maintain no traditional gender stigma, and any discrimination is individual and not systemic.

While the clergy, known as the High House of the Pale Seers, make laws and have the final say, day-to-day administration in the Inner Circle is done by a collection of ancient hereditary monarchies, collectively referred to as the members of the Low House of Pale Seers. The Low House has no restrictions based on sex or gender, although High House officials are typically recruited from them.

In addition to the two houses of the Pale Seers and the military branch that is the Somber Host, a third branch of the ruling government exists, the Crimson Wardens. Organized into great towers known as Warden Fortresses that can operate independently in each district they are established in, Crimson Wardens have a variety of miscellaneous responsibilities in the city. Crimson Paladins are the only truly militant arm of the branch, and typically accompany the other agents within it. Red Clairvoyants offer healing and divination to the faithful, and  Constables and Blackcoats investigate crimes and police the streets respectively, all three of them serving under the district oversight of an Abettor.

Collectively, the government comprised of these three branches is referred to as the Ashen Chantry.

The Outer Circle is less strictly organized, typically independently governed according to their own systems, although with scattered independent Warden Fortresses placed around the larger settlements. They are entirely excluded from recruitment into the High House.
